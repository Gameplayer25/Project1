            <p>I am a student at Kennesaw State University (KSU), pursuing a degree in Information Technology. I have developed skills in web development and computer science during my time at KSU. My goal is to apply these skills in real-world applications and continue learning in the field of information technology.</p>
            <p>I have experience in coding using Python, Java, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
            <p>I have worked on several projects, including [mention a few projects], which helped me strengthen my problem-solving and coding abilities.</p>
            <p>In the future, I aim to work in the tech industry as a cyber security engineer, and contribute to innovative projects that solve real-world challenges.</p>
